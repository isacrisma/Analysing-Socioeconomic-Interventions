This study explores the impact of the Colombian conditional cash transfer Familias en Acci√≥n (FA) on labor market outcomes. While FA benefits had been previously linked to higher educational attainment, reduction in child labor, and improved health status, their impact on labor supply has received less attention. Using data from Colombia's ELCA survey, the study analyzes beneficiaries' labor supply responses in terms of hours worked and participation in the workforce. To identify adjustments in the employment sector, the study also considers the impact of FA transfers on the likelihood of working in the informal economy. The study population includes household heads in urban and rural areas, segmented by gender and single household heads to explore response differences across sub-groups. Relying on a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) estimator suited for multiple periods and variation in treatment timing, results show that FA transfers exert a negative impact on labor supply. Overall, beneficiary households reduce their weekly hours worked by approximately 3.39 hours. Single parents, especially single mothers, experience a more significant reduction of 4.70 hours. Similarly, the likelihood of labor force participation decreases by 7.92 percentage points in the first year of receiving benefits, further declining with prolonged exposure. In contrast, the study finds no discernible effect on informal sector employment.
